> # How to use:
#### Requirements:
- Nothing! The newly designed compiler will handle **everything** for your convenience!

#### Preparation:
- Create a Discord Bot and [get it's token](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md#discord-bot-token)
- [Create a bot invite link](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md#proper-bot-invite-link) and add it to your server
- Store the [Notification ID](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md#channel-id) and [Server ID](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md#server-ids) along with the token for ease of access

#### Steps:
1. Dowload the latest release of NullRAT (recommended) [**git clone**/**download zip** are no longer supported]
2. Run the Compiler and follow the prompts. NullRAT payload will be right there!
